Hello! I am Bhuvan, and welcome to my personal dumpster fire. The interweb is both a raging dumpster fire that is about to burn everything and the toilet wall of Suvarna Shouchalaya near Majestic bustand. But in between the noxious flames of the spreading fire, you can still find some wonderful and delightful things. This website is my utterly messy digital garden, where I share the spoils of my dumpster diving.
