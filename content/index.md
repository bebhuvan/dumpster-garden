Hello! I am Bhuvan, and welcome to my personal dumpster fire. The interweb is both a raging dumpster fire that is about to burn everything and the toilet wall of Suvarna Shouchalaya near Majestic bustand. But in between the noxious flames of the spreading fire, you can still find some wonderful and delightful things. This website is my utterly messy digital garden, where I share the spoils of my dumpster diving.

## About
[What's the point of this website?](/about)

## Categories
Each dumpster has its own charm:
- [[landfill/index|The Landfill]] - Long-form essays and deep dives
- [[dumpster-diving/index|Dumpster Diving]] - Interesting finds from around the web
- [[litter/index|Litter]] - Quick thoughts and shorter musings
- [[scribbles/index|Scribbles]] - Quotes
- [[salvage/index|Salvage]] - Whatever is leftover

## Newsletter and RSS
I also send out whatever I write as a [newsletter](https://bhuvan.substack.com/). So, if you'd like to add another newsletter to the list of newsletters you've already subscribed to but aren't reading, mine qualifies.

You can also subscribe via [RSS](/index.xml) 📡 if you are a luddite. 

## Navigation Tips
Just click on one of the categories, browse the explorer, or search for something. This garden of mine is deliberately messy and will remain so. It's a place with all the things I am exploring, so hopefully, you'll discover some new rabbit holes to go tumbling down.
